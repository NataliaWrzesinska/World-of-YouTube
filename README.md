**Tools and Technologies Used**  
- **Microsoft Excel**: Employed for data cleaning, including filling missing data in the 'country' and 'category' columns, and correcting data types.
- **SQL**: Used for structured querying and data manipulation to prepare the dataset for visualization.
- **Power BI**: Chosen for its robust data visualization capabilities, enabling the creation of an interactive data dashboard.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
An extensive EDA was conducted to understand the dataset's underlying structure, quality, and to extract meaningful insights. This process involved:
- Identifying anomalies and outliers.
- Understanding the distribution and relationships of variables.
- Performing statistical summaries and visualizations.
